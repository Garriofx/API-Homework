# API-Homework
# This project, written in Python, creates two tools used for the purposes of financial planning: it creates Personal Finance Planner that allows for users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies, and it creates a Retirement Planning Tool that will use the Alpaca Market API to pull historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
